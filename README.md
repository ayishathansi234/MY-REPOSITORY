# MY-REPOSITORY
In software development, a repository is a central file storage location. It is used by version control systems to store multiple versions of files. While a repository can be configured on a local machine for a single user, it is often stored on a server, which can be accessed by multiple users.
repository is a place where things are stored for safe keeping, or where there is an ample supply of something, or a person or thing with a lot of information about something.
